The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players need to follow a sequence of lights and sounds. Here's how it works in simple terms:

1. How It Starts:

    * The game begins by lighting up one color (or playing one sound).
    * The player has to remember this and repeat it by pressing the corresponding button.

2. How It Progresses:

    * After the player gets the first sequence right, the game adds another color (or sound) to the sequence.
    * The player then has to repeat the new, longer sequence.

3. Challenge:

    * With each round, the sequence becomes longer and harder to remember.

4. Game Over:

    * The game ends when the player makes a mistake, like pressing the wrong button or forgetting the order.

5. Objective:

    * The goal is to get the longest sequence possible and beat your previous high score.



Itâ€™s a fun game that tests and improves memory and concentration skills!
